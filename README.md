# Spam Detection System

This project implements a machine learning-based spam detection system that classifies emails as spam or not. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze email content and predict spam.

## Features

- Classifies emails as **spam** or **not spam**.
- Uses **NLP techniques** for text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, etc.).
- Trains and evaluates **machine learning models** for spam prediction.
- Can be easily extended to handle more data and models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detection.git
   cd spam-detection
